        <h1 className="document-title-text">Custom Domains</h1>
        <br />
        <p className="document-p-text">
          Cre8tly Studio may allow eligible users to connect and use a custom
          domain name with their landing pages and digital products. By adding a
          custom domain, you represent and warrant that you are the legal owner
          of the domain or have full authorization to use and control it. You
          grant Cre8tly Studio permission to route traffic, provision security
          certificates, and host content associated with the domain for the
          purpose of providing the Services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="document-p-text">
          Custom domains are not activated until ownership has been verified
          through DNS configuration or other technical validation methods
          determined by Cre8tly Studio. We do not serve content on unverified
          domains. You are solely responsible for maintaining control of your
          domain and ensuring that it does not infringe upon trademarks,
          intellectual property rights, or applicable laws.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="document-p-text">
          Cre8tly Studio reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend,
          disable, or remove any custom domain that is used for unlawful
          activity, trademark infringement, impersonation, abuse, or violation
          of these Terms, without prior notice. Loss of access to a custom
          domain does not entitle you to a refund of subscription fees or
          credits.

          All purchases, subscriptions, and credits made through our platform
          are final, as outlined in our Refund Policy. By making a purchase, you
          agree to provide valid and accurate payment details. We reserve the
          right to refuse or cancel any order suspected of fraud or unauthorized
          use. Pricing is subject to change at our discretion.

          Seller Dashboard, Marketplace Sales, and Stripe Connect
        </h1>
        <br />
        <p className="document-p-text">
          Cre8tly Studio provides tools that allow independent sellers to
          upload, price, and sell their digital products through their own
          landing pages using the Seller Dashboard. By becoming a seller, you
          acknowledge and agree to the following:
          <br />
          <br />
          • All seller payments and payouts are processed through Stripe
          Connect, and sellers must maintain a valid Stripe Express account to
          receive funds.
          <br />
          • Cre8tly Studio is a platform provider and is not the merchant of
          record for seller products. All digital items sold through landing
          pages are created and owned by the seller.
          <br />
          • Sellers are fully responsible for the accuracy, legality, and
          quality of the digital products they provide, including PDFs, guides,
          templates, or any uploaded content.
          <br />
          • All sales made through seller landing pages are final. Cre8tly
          Studio does not issue refunds for seller products and is not
          responsible for disputes between buyers and sellers.
          <br />
          • In the event of a technical issue involving file delivery, Cre8tly
          Studio may assist in verifying delivery errors but is not required to
          modify, replace, or refund seller content.
          <br />
          • Sellers are responsible for complying with all applicable laws,
          including taxes, content rights, and consumer protection regulations
          related to the digital products they offer.

        <h1 className="document-title-text">Digital Products and Slots</h1>
        <br />
        <p className="document-p-text">
          Lead magnet slots and generated PDFs are digital products licensed for
          your own use. You may not resell, redistribute, or use them for
          automated scraping or mass content generation beyond what is permitted
          by your plan. Slots cannot be exchanged, refunded, or rolled over once
          purchased. Misuse of slots, including attempts to exceed system
          safeguards, may result in account suspension without refund.
