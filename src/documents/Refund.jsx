          At Drama Music, we strive to deliver the highest quality music and
          digital products. Because of the nature of digital downloads and
          instant delivery, our refund policy is limited. Please read the
          details below carefully before making your purchase.

        <h1 className="document-title-text">Eligibility for Refunds</h1>
        <br />
        <p className="document-p-text">
          Refund requests may be granted under the following circumstances:
          <br /><br />
          • The customer&apos;s account is in good standing <br />
          • The product has not been downloaded, installed, or activated <br />
          • The product is found to be defective, corrupted, or does not work as described <br />
          • The product is incompatible due to an error on our side <br />
        </p>
        <br />

        <p className="document-p-text">
          If a product has already been downloaded or accessed, we generally
          cannot issue a refund. However, we will always review cases where the
          product is defective or unusable. Please note that error messages
          related to incorrect setup, software conflicts, or device
          configuration do not necessarily mean the product is defective.
        </p>

          Refund requests must be submitted within <strong>7 calendar days</strong> 
          from the date of purchase. After this period, all sales are considered
          final.
